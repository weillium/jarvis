# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables

   Create a `.env.local` file in the `mobile` directory:

   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

   Then edit `.env.local` and add your Supabase credentials:

   ```
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54421
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
   ```

   **Note:** The `.env.local` file is already in `.gitignore` and will not be committed to version control.

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
